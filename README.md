# Arduino Tetris Game

A classic Tetris implementation based on Arduino and OLED screens, supporting dual-screen display (game main interface + info panel) and developed using an STM32 board.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32 development board (e.g., ZLAB_F103VE)
- 128x64 SSD1306 OLED screens x2 (one SPI + one I2C)
- 5 push buttons
- Connection details:

  ```
  Main screen (SPI):
    CS  -> PA4
    DC  -> PB1
    RES -> PB0

  Info screen (I2C):
    SCL -> PB6
    SDA -> PB7

  Buttons:
    Left   -> PE12
    Right  -> PE8
    Down   -> PE11
    Up     -> PE9
    Rotate -> PE10
  ```

## Software Dependencies

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- U8g2 library (OLED driver)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the U8g2 library (via Arduino Library Manager).
3. Connect the hardware devices.
4. Compile and upload the code to the development board.

## Controls

### Button Functions

- Left/Right: Move horizontally
- Down: Soft drop (accelerated descent)
- Up: Hard drop (instant descent)
- Rotate button: Rotate clockwise
- Press Left + Right simultaneously: Pause, resume with the Rotate button

### Game States

- Splash screen: Press the Rotate button to start
- In-game: Shows the current tetromino and ghost preview
- Pause: Displays PAUSE message
- Game Over: Displays GAME OVER, press Rotate button to retry

## Game Features

- Complete SRS rotation system (supports Wall Kick)
- Ghost piece preview
- Multi-level acceleration system (level up every 10 lines cleared)
- Scoring system:
  - Soft drop: 1 point/line
  - Hard drop: 2 points/line
  - Line clear: 100 points/line Ã— Level
- 7-bag randomizer
- Dual-screen display:
  - Main screen: Game area
  - Info screen: Score/Level/Next piece
